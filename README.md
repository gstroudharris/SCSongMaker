# SCSongMaker
Purpose: To create a simple JS program that allows you to input build orders, and let you play out "songs" based on those build orders, and real situations that would arise during the course of a game. 

To Do:

MVP:
An interface with the first tier of Protoss units that lets you play the song of early game: 
Build probe
Build pylon
Build warpgate
Bind hotkeys
Rotate between hotkeys and building probes
etc.

Future:
Build order editor
Build counters (Song tempo changes)
GUI with build times, probe scouting, and situation/song changes mid-song (to adapt for different counters/builds)
